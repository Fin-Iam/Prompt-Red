# GitHub Copilot â€“ Repository Instructions

This repository contains Prompt-Red, a Bug Bounty Pentesting lab for Red Teams that spawns within the browser.

## General Guidelines

- This is a security research and educational tool focused on bug bounty and penetration testing
- Code should prioritize security awareness and demonstrate common vulnerabilities for educational purposes
- All code should be written with clear educational intent and proper warnings about ethical use

## Code Style

- Write clear, readable code with descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments to explain complex security concepts or vulnerability demonstrations
- Follow consistent formatting and indentation

## Security Practices

- Never include real credentials, API keys, or sensitive data in the codebase
- Use placeholder values for demonstrations (e.g., `EXAMPLE_API_KEY`, `demo@example.com`)
- Include clear warnings and ethical use disclaimers in documentation
- Ensure all vulnerability demonstrations are sandboxed and cannot cause real harm

## Documentation

- Document all security concepts and vulnerabilities being demonstrated
- Include usage examples and explanations for educational purposes
- Provide clear setup instructions for lab environments
- Add comments explaining how vulnerabilities work and how to mitigate them

## Testing

- Test all features in isolated/sandboxed environments
- Verify that demonstrations work as intended for educational purposes
- Ensure nothing can accidentally affect real systems
